# How to host your website on GitHub pages 

## Static sites
Also, many WordPress sites are not as fast as they should be because it is generating content dynamically as the user requests it, unless using a cache plugin, which is effectively saving a “static” copy of the site.

What about installing WordPress on a local computer, writing the site and publishing only static content to the public web? This would provide:

1.  free hosting for static websites with  [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
2.  the speed and security of a static site
3.  the usability and resourcefulness of WordPress

### For this tutorial we will be using Windows, to make wordpress installation easier. Therefore, if you are on Ubuntu I suggest before starting to log into Windows.
